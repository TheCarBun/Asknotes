## Inspiration for this project:
During my university days, one of the biggest challenges I faced was studying from notes provided in the form of PDFs. Whether it was preparing for term exams or solving previous year's question papers, the process was time-consuming and often frustrating. Scrolling through countless pages just to find relevant answers felt like looking for a needle in a haystack. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è <br>
That‚Äôs why I built AskNotes‚Äîan AI-powered tool designed to make studying faster, smarter, and more efficient! üöÄ<br>
With AskNotes, you can:<br>
 ‚úÖ Upload your notes in PDF format.<br>
 ‚úÖ Ask specific questions about the content.<br>
 ‚úÖ Get instant, accurate answers in just a few seconds.<br>
No more wasting hours flipping through pages. Let AskNotes do the heavy lifting so you can focus on what matters most‚Äîunderstanding and learning.

## About
AskNotes is an interactive learning application designed for students to upload their study materials (in PDF format) and get AI-powered assistance in understanding the content. Built using Streamlit and LangChain, AskNotes provides a question-and-answer interface to query the content within PDF files, offering a personalized learning experience.

## Features
- **Upload Study Materials**: Students can upload one or multiple PDFs containing study materials.
- **Interactive Q&A**: Ask questions about the uploaded content, and AskNotes will provide relevant answers.
- **Session-based Chat**: Tracks chat history during each session, allowing users to refer back to previous interactions.
- **Secure and Temporary Storage**: Uploaded PDFs are temporarily stored for processing and deleted automatically after use.
- **Streamlit UI**: A user-friendly chat interface for engaging with AskNotes, implemented using `streamlit_chat`.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for UI.
- **Backend**: LangChain (for Q&A processing), FAISS (for efficient vector storage and retrieval).
- **Embeddings and Language Models**: OpenAI embeddings and ChatGPT (gpt-4) for natural language understanding and answer generation.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API Key (for embeddings and GPT-4 model)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TheCarBun/Asknotes.git
    cd Asknotes
    ```
   
2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up OpenAI API key**:
   Add your OpenAI API key to Streamlit secrets by creating a `secrets.toml` file in the `.streamlit` folder:
    ```toml
    [OPENAI_API_KEY]
    key = "your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```

4. **Run the app**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Error Handling

The app includes exception handling for better stability:
- **API Key Missing**: Displays an error if the OpenAI API key is not configured correctly.
- **File Loading**: Catches errors when loading PDFs and warns the user if a file cannot be processed.
- **Vectorstore Creation**: Handles issues during vectorstore creation, providing user feedback on errors.
- **Query Processing**: Informs the user if an error occurs while querying the vectorstore.
- **Temp File Deletion**: Any issues with file deletion after processing are logged to avoid storage issues.

These exceptions ensure a more resilient app and a smoother user experience.

---

## Future Enhancements
- **Support for Additional File Types**: Extend support to handle TXT, DOCX, and EPUB files for broader usability.
- **Answer Summarization**: Include a summarization option for longer responses.
- **Enhanced NLP**: Add fine-tuning capabilities to improve relevance and answer quality based on specific course material.
- **User Authentication**: Implement session tracking with user authentication to store user chat history for later review.
